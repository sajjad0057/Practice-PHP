============================ DEPENDENCY_INJECTION =================================

Dependency injection is a procedure where one object supplies the dependencies of another object.
Dependency Injection is a software design approach that allows avoiding hard-coding dependencies and 
makes it possible to change the dependencies both at runtime and compile time.
