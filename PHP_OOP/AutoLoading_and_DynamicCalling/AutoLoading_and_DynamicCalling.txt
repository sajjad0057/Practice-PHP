===================== AutoLoading_and_DynamicCalling =========================

-> Auto Loading or Automatic Loading is a feature that will help you to load php file dynamically when it is used in the program . 

-> Use Case :

    -> Instead if require-once all the files you can use the PHP build in function to include them when it is called . 

    -> This way you don't have to include files and allow them to load dynamically .
