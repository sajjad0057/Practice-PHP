<-------------    INHERITANCE = REUSABILITY    ------------------->

-> If you want to reuse an existing class Properties and Methods in your class then you extend that class to your class (this is called inheritance) .

-> Parant class Properties and Methods extends will be available to child classes. (It is Hierarchy - inherits)

-> You can restrict the access of the Properties and Methods to child classes via  using 'protected' access Modifiers .
